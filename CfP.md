## The Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, November 19 2020
Co-located with EMNLP 2020 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic

[https://cmclorg.github.io](https://cmclorg.github.io)

## Invited Speakers

We are pleased to announce that Richard Futrell (University of California Irvine) and Suzanne Stevenson (University of Toronto) are our invited speakers for CMCL 2020.


## Workshop Description

Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2020 is a one-day workshop held in conjunction with the Annual Conference on Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Punta Cana (Dominican Republic), November 16-20 2020. The goal of CMCL is providing a venue for computational research on cognitive theories of language processing, representation and acquisition. The 2020 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015, EACL 2017, LSA 2018 and NAACL 2019.



## Scope and Topics

Topics of interest for the workshop include:

- Stochastic models of factors influencing a speaker’s production or comprehension decisions
- Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition
- Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility
- Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization
- Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing
- Behavioral tasks for better understanding neural models of linguistic representation
- Models and empirical analysis of the relationship between mechanistic psycholinguistic principles and pragmatics or semantics
- Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics
- Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction
- Psychologically plausible models of lexical or conceptual representations
- Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia
- Behavioral datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English
- Models of language comprehension difficulty
- Models of language learning and generalization
- Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities
- Network Science and Language Processing


## Workshop Submissions

We accept three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website: [https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/cmcl2020/](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/cmcl2020/). To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors. Submissions with associated preprints (e.g. arXiv) will be considered. 
Submissions must be formatted using EMNLP 2020 templates, available at: [https://2020.emnlp.org/call-for-papers](https://2020.emnlp.org/call-for-papers).

Regular Workshop Papers can be either full (8 pages of content + references) or short papers (4 pages + references) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop (oral presentation or poster) and will be published in the workshop proceedings. If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it at submission time. Papers to be presented at CMCL 2020 must be withdrawn from other venues.

Extended Abstracts (from 2 to 4 pages + references) describe preliminary work or results that have not been published before. Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

We will also accept cross-submissions (from 2 to 4 pages + references) for papers on related topics that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g. CogSci). These papers will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the proceedings. Interested authors are asked to add a note on the original venue in the submission.


### Dual Submission Policy (only for Regular Workshop Papers)

If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it a submission time.
Papers to be presented at CMCL 2020 must be withdrawn from other venues.


## Important Dates

- Notification of acceptance: August 17, 2020
- Camera-ready version due: August 31, 2020
