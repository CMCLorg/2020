## Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2020

## Workshop Description

Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) provides a venue for computational research on cognitive theories of language processing, representation and acquisition. Language, fundamentally, is used by humans, who have variable linguistic backgrounds, cultures, and knowledge. Being able to capture the cognitive bases of human knowledge of their language using computational methods is an often unstated but fundamental goal of NLP. The aim of this workshop is to better relate computational approaches to language to human cognition, and vice versa, and is applicable to a wide range of fields within NLP, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science.


## Scope and Topics

Topics of interest for the workshop include:

- Stochastic models of factors influencing a speaker’s production or comprehension decisions
- Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition
- Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility
- Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization
- Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing
- Behavioral tasks for better understanding neural models of linguistic representation
- Models and empirical analysis of the relationship between mechanistic psycholinguistic principles and pragmatics or semantics
- Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics
- Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction
- Psychologically plausible models of lexical or conceptual representations
- Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia
- Behavioral datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English
- Models of language comprehension difficulty
- Models of language learning and generalization
- Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities


## Workshop Submissions

We accept three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website: <b> TO BE ANNOUNCED </b>.
To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors.

Submissions must be formatted using EMNLP 2020 templates, available at: <b> TO BE ANNOUNCED </b>.
If essentially identical papers are submitted to multiple conferences / workshops, the authors are asked to indicate this fact at submission time.

- Regular Submissions Papers can be either full (8 pages of content + references) or short papers (4 pages + references) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop (oral presentation or poster) and will be published in the workshop proceedings.

- Extended Abstracts (from 2 to 4 pages + references) describe preliminary work or results that have not been published before. Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

We will also accept Cross-submissions (from 2 to 4 pages + references) for papers on related topics that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g. CogSci). These papers will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the proceedings. Interested authors are asked to add a note on the original venue in the submission.


### Dual Submission Policy (only for Regular Workshop Papers)

If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it a submission time.
Papers to be presented at CMCL 2020 must be withdrawn from other venues.
