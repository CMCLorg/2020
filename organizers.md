- <b>Emmanuele Chersoni</b>, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 
  * Emmanuele is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His main research interests include distributional semantic models, thematic fit modeling, automatic discovery of semantic relations and sentence processing. He served as a co-organizer of the CMCL workshop in Minneapolis in 2019, and as a member of the Local Organizing Committee for EMNLP 2019 in Hong Kong.

- <b>Cassandra Jacobs</b>, University of Wisconsin 
  * Cassandra studies the intersection between human memory and linguistic experience. She has used a mixture of Bayesian and neural network models trained on natural language corpora to simulate how people learn language, how they represent the meanings of words and multiword expressions, and how they remember what others say. She has particular expertise in predicting spoken language prosody and models of distributional semantics. She served as an organizer of the 2018 meeting of CMCL in Salt Lake City, has organized symposia within the field of cognitive psychology on interdisciplinary questions in psycholinguistics, and served on the 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Committee for NAACL 2019.

- <b>Yohei Oseki</b>, Waseda University
  * Yohei Oseki is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Waseda University and a visiting scholar at RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP). Before joining Waseda University, he received a Ph.D. from the Department of Linguistics at New York University in 2018 and was a visiting scholar at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. His research integrates natural language processing with cognitive science of language and attempts to reverse-engineer the most “human-like” language model. He founded Computational Psycholinguistics Tokyo (CPT) and also organized workshops on computational psycholinguistics and neuroscience.

- <b>Laurent Prévot</b>, Aix-Marseille University
  * Laurent Prévot is a professor in Language Sciences at Aix Marseille Université and the director of Laboratoire Parole et Langage. He is also a junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF). His specialties are linguistics (in particular semantic and pragmatic questions) and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on the computational modeling of discourse and interaction phenomena in spontaneous conversations. He had been the a Program Co-chair and Local Organizer of The 22nd Workshop on Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue (SEMDIAL); an organization committee member of TALN 2014 conference; former Program Manager for Humanities and Social Sciences, France-Taiwan Frontiers of Science and Co-organizer of Workshops Logics and Semantics of Natural Language from 2008 to 2010.

- <b>Enrico Santus</b>, CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Enrico Santus is postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His current research is focused on Information Extraction and Question Answering. His previous research has investigated lexical distributional semantics, with attention to similarity and relation identification, as well as thematic fit estimation. He has been co-chair in ESSLLI 2016 and *SEM 2018, and he organized numerous shared tasks, including SemEval-2018 Task 9 on Hypernymy Discovery and the CogALex-V Shared Task on the Corpus-Based Identification of Semantic Relations.
